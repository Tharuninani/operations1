9.Question
Alice was bored that day,so she was sitting on the riverbank .Suddenly  she notices a talking, White Rabbit with a pocket watch .It ran fast,and she followed it, down a rabbit hole .She fell into the hole and found a magical wonderland with dark trees, beautiful flowers.She found many ways numbered from 1,2,3,........18.she was confused which is the right way that will lead her to her home. She found a cute bird, standing in one of the tree. Alice asked the bird the way to go back to her home.The bird said a two digit number( say 23 ) and asked her to find the sum of its digits (2+3=5) and that numbered way will lead her to her home.Alice was already confused, so pls help Alice in finding the route to her home....
